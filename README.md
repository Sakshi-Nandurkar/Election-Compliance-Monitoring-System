# Election Commission System  

## Overview  
The Election Commission System is a Java-based project developed using Hibernate to manage election-related data. It follows a layered architecture comprising entity, DAO, service, and controller layers, ensuring a clean separation of concerns. The project efficiently performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on various entities and is designed for scalability and maintainability.

## Features  
- CRUD operations for managing election-related data.  
- Modular design with separate layers for entities, business logic, and database operations.  
- Implementation of Hibernate for seamless interaction with the database.  
- Endpoints for handling client requests and providing structured responses.

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Java  
- **Framework**: Hibernate  
- **Database**: (Specify the database used, e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL)  
- **Tools**: Postman (for testing APIs), Maven

## Project Architecture  

1. **Entity Layer**: Represents database tables as Java classes.  
2. **DAO Layer**: Handles all database operations using Hibernate.  
3. **Service Layer**: Contains business logic and acts as an intermediary between DAO and Controller.  
4. **Controller Layer**: Exposes endpoints for client interaction and processes requests through the service layer.

## Flow of the Program  

1. **Client Interaction**: Users send requests to the system via API endpoints (e.g., to create, read, update, or delete election-related data).  
2. **Controller Layer**: The controller processes incoming requests and forwards them to the service layer.  
3. **Service Layer**: The service layer applies business logic and passes the processed data to the DAO layer.  
4. **DAO Layer**: The DAO layer interacts with the database using Hibernate to perform the required operations.  
5. **Response**: The processed data or result of the operation is sent back through the service and controller layers to the client.
